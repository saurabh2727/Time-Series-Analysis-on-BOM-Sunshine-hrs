Forecast sunshine hours in a day

In this report we will forecast sunshine hours in a day. Solar energy is a renewable energy. One million Australian
households have rooftop solar photovoltaic systems where energy from the sun is the major factor. The modelling
of this dataset assists energy companies to forecast electricity supply from photovoltaic systems.
We identify the best model from the possible set of candidate models. We will use the best model to provide
forecast of sunshine hours for the next 10 days.
The dataset contains daily weather observations taken at Melbourne (Olympic Park), Victoria by Bureau of
Meteorology (BOM). The dataset is in a csv file. The data has been obtained for the period between 1st may 2018
and 21st may 2020. The dataset contains 752 observations and the units are in hours per day.
The trend of the sunshine hours series is stochastic for any particular time period. Even though it is stochastic, we
will try to fit both deterministic and stochastic trend/seasonal models as candidate models. We will choose the
best model based on residual analysis.
